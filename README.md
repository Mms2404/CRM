# CRM
A Flutter-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application designed to manage customers and their orders with offline-first support. This project integrates Firebase Firestore for cloud storage, Firebase Authentication for login/signup, and local storage for offline operations. Additionally, it can fetch random company data via a free API for quick customer addition.
